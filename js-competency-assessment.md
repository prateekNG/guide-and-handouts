# **Hackathon Guide: Empowering Young Women in Tech**

### **Overview**

Welcome to the hackathon! This challenge is designed to let you showcase your JavaScript skills by building a solution to a real-world problem relevant to young women preparing for careers in tech. You'll have the opportunity to develop a project that could help others in similar situations while demonstrating your technical skills with JavaScript, DOM manipulation, API integration, and, optionally, full-stack development.

### **Theme: Real-World Impact**

The theme of this hackathon is **“Empowering Young Women in Tech.”** Your task is to build a JavaScript-based solution that addresses a real-world problem faced by students or young women pursuing careers in technology.

Some possible problem ideas include:
- A **study tool** (e.g., a flashcard app for programming concepts)
- A **community platform** (e.g., a simple chat interface or forum)
- A **career readiness tool** (e.g., a job application tracker, resume builder, or interview prep guide)

Choose a problem that resonates with you and create a solution that could make a positive difference!

### **Project Requirements**

Your solution should meet the following technical requirements. Regardless of the problem you choose to address, these guidelines ensure that core JavaScript concepts are applied in your project.

#### **1. Core Functionality: Basic JavaScript and DOM Manipulation**
   - Use basic JavaScript elements like **variables, loops, and conditionals**.
   - **DOM Manipulation**: Include interactive features where users can dynamically add or remove elements (e.g., tasks in a to-do list, flashcards, or messages in a chat).
   - **Event Handling**: Use JavaScript events (e.g., clicks or form submissions) to make the app responsive and interactive.

#### **2. Intermediate JavaScript Concepts: Data Structures and Modular Code**
   - Use **objects** and **arrays** to store data (e.g., for each to-do item, flashcard, or chat message).
   - Organize your code with **functions or modules** that handle specific tasks, like adding or deleting information.

#### **3. Asynchronous JavaScript: API Fetching**
   - **Fetch data from a public API**: Include data from a relevant external API (e.g., inspirational quotes, programming tips, or local weather information).
   - **Error Handling**: Implement error-handling for your API calls to ensure the app responds smoothly if the data fetching fails.

#### **4. JavaScript Framework/Library (Frontend)**
   - **Framework Requirement**: Use a popular JavaScript framework, such as **React** or **Vue**.
   - **Component-Based Structure**: Break your application into reusable components (e.g., each task, flashcard, or chat message could be a component in your app).

#### **5. Full Stack Integration**
   - **Node.js Backend**: Add a Node.js backend to handle data storage and retrieval. For example, you could build a simple backend to store and retrieve user information, chat messages, or to-do items.
   - **Data Flow**: Ensure data is synchronized smoothly between the frontend and backend using JSON.

### **Submission Guidelines**

To help us understand your project, please follow these submission guidelines:

1. **Code Repository**: 
   - Share your code through a public repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.), organized into folders for frontend and backend (if applicable).
   
2. **Project Documentation**:
   - In the repository, include a README file with:
     - The **problem you chose** to address and why it’s meaningful.
     - An **overview of your solution** and the main features.
     - Any challenges you encountered and how you addressed them.

3. **Optional Video Demo**:
   - (Optional) Record a short video (no longer than 5 minutes) showcasing the core features of your project.

### **Evaluation Criteria**

Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Problem Relevance**: Does the chosen problem align with the theme of empowering young women in tech?
2. **Technical Proficiency**: Does your solution demonstrate JavaScript skills across each technical requirement?
3. **User Interaction and Experience**: Is the application user-friendly and does it respond well to user input?
4. **Code Structure and Readability**: Is the code organized, modular, and easy to understand?
5. **Optional Full Stack Knowledge**: For those who add backend features, is the data flow managed effectively between frontend and backend?

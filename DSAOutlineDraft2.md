2. **Real-World Applications**: How the concept is used in real-world scenarios.
3. **Common Problems**: A list of standard problems to solve.
4. **Implementation**: JavaScript code snippets for each concept and problem.
5. **Projects**: Small projects to apply multiple concepts together.  Include project ideas with varying complexity to gradually challenge learners.

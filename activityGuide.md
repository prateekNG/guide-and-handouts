# Batao Activity: Create a Snake Game!

This activity will guide you through using Batao to create a simple snake game, demonstrating iterative code development with AI assistance.

**Objectives:**

* Learn to use Batao to generate code from prompts.
* Understand how to embed code in Markdown files for enhanced interaction with Batao.
* Experience an iterative approach to code development using AI.

**Time:**  30 minutes (maximum)

**Prerequisites:**

* Install Batao as described in the README above.
* Have a text editor or IDE for viewing and editing code files.

**Code Embedding in Markdown:**

Before starting, let's quickly recap how to embed code in Markdown. This is essential for providing code to Batao and ensuring proper syntax highlighting.

Use triple backticks (```) before and after your code block. You can optionally specify the language after the first set of backticks for syntax highlighting.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Take 5-10 minutes to read the following resource and try out code embedding: [Creating and Highlighting Code Blocks on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)

Create a markdown file (.md extension) as `prompt.md` and paste the below content and run the command `batao -i prompt.md -o code_explanation.md -m pro`:

````markdown
I'm new to programming, I'm having trouble understanding how the below HTML and CSS code works to make a responsive photo gallery page. Break it down and explain in detail using simple Indian English.

index.html
```html
<div class="gallery">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
</div>
```
style.css
```css
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 10px;
}

.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```
````
Open the response file `code_explanation.md` and go through the explanation of the above code. 

**Advantage:** Code embedding makes your prompts clearer to Batao, allowing for better analysis and responses. Syntax highlighting further improves readability and understanding.

## Activity Steps:

### Step 1: Generate the Initial Snake Game Structure

1. **Create a Markdown file:** Create a new file named `snake_game.md`.
2. **Add the prompt:** Inside `snake_game.md`, write the following prompt:

   ```markdown
   Create a simple snake-like game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use the canvas element for the game UI.  Provide the code within separate code blocks for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   ```

3. **Run Batao:** Execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   batao -i snake_game.md -o snake_code.md
   ```

   This command tells Batao to read the prompt from `snake_game.md` and save the generated code into a file named `snake_code.md`.  If you encounter a "RECITATION error", retry the command.

4. **Examine the Output:** Open `snake_code.md`. You should have HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a basic snake game, similar to the example below:

   ````markdown
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Snake Game</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Snake</h1>
       <canvas id="gameCanvas" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
       <script src="script.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   ```css
   body {
       background-color: #333;
       color: #eee;
       font-family: monospace;
       text-align: center;
   }

   canvas {
       background-color: #000;
       border: 2px solid #eee;
   }
   ```

   ```javascript
   const canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');
   const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

   const snake = [{ x: 10, y: 10 }];
   let food = {};
   let dx = 1;
   let dy = 0;

   function generateFood() {
       food = {
           x: Math.floor(Math.random() * (canvas.width / 10)),
           y: Math.floor(Math.random() * (canvas.height / 10))
       };
   }

   // more functions like for implementing the game logic like draw(), update(), etc
   ```
   ````

5.  **Create HTML, CSS and JS files:** Manually create three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. Copy the respective code blocks from `snake_code.md` and paste them into their corresponding files. Save these files in the same directory.

6.  **Run the game:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the basic snake game generated by AI. 


### Step 2:  Iterative Refinement

Now the fun begins!  Let's make some changes to our game using Batao:

1. **Change the Game Speed:**

   * **Add to Prompt:** Open `snake_code.md` and add the following above the existing code blocks, keeping the previous code:

     ```markdown
     Modify the code below to make the snake move twice as slow.

     // Output generated in the previous request...
     ```

   * **Run Batao:** 
     ```bash
     batao -i snake_code.md -o snake_code.md
     ``` 

   * **Test:** Open the updated `snake_code.md`, copy the updated JavaScript code block and replace the code in your `script.js` file. Open or refresh the `index.html` file in a browser to test the change. If the change isn't what you expected, refine your prompt and try again.

2. **Change the Background Color:**

   * **Add to Prompt:** Add the following to your `snake_code.md` file, below the previous content:

     ```markdown
     Modify the CSS above to change the background color of the game canvas to lightblue.

     // Output generated in the previous request...
     ```

   * **Run Batao, Test, Repeat!** Follow the same steps as before: run Batao, copy the updated CSS code block from `snake_code.md` and replace the code in `style.css`, then test the changes in your browser, and refine if needed.

3. **Add a Score Display:**

   * **Add to Prompt:** 

     ```markdown
     Modify the code below to add a score display at the top-left corner of the screen. The score should increase every time the snake eats a piece of food.

     // Output generated in the previous request...
     ```

   * **Run, Test, Repeat!** Continue the process of adding prompts, running Batao, and testing by updating your `script.js` file with the generated JavaScript code. 

### Step 3: Experiment and Have Fun!

You've got the hang of it! Here are a few more ideas to try:

* **Change Food Appearance:** Make the food a different shape or color.
* **Add Obstacles:** Introduce walls or barriers to the game. 
* **Game Over Condition:** Implement a game over state when the snake hits itself or a boundary.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Important Notes:**
>
>* **RECITATION Error:** If you get this error, simply re-run your Batao command.
>* **Prompt Clarity:** Be as clear and specific as possible in your prompts for the best results.
>* **Iterative Development:** Remember, good software development is iterative! Don't be afraid to make small changes and test frequently. 
Have fun coding with Batao!
